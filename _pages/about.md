Hello, World. 

I am currently a Master's Student at Fordham University studying Machine Learning. Prior to this, I studied Mathematics at Fordham University for my undergraduate, worked at my old high school, and worked at two tech start-ups ([nTopology](https://ntopology.com/), [Instrumental](https://www.instrumental.com/)).
